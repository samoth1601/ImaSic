THE FORMULAS
Hereâ€™s a list of whole-half step scale formulas:
W = Whole step, H = Half step, WH = Whole and a half step (3 half steps or frets).

Major scale = W-W-H-W-W-W-H (2-2-1-2-2-2-1)
Natuaral Minor scale = W-H-W-W-H-W-W (2-1-2-2-1-2-2)
Minor pentatonic scale = WH-W-W-WH-W (3-2-2-3-2)
Blues scale = WH-W-H-H-WH-W (3-2-1-1-3-2)
Major pentatonic scale = W-W-WH-W-WH (2 2 3 2 3)
Harmonic Minor scale = W-H-W-W-H-WH-H (2-1-2-2-1-3-2)
Melodic Minor scale = W-H-W-W-W-W-H (2-1-2-2-2-2-1)
Ionian scale = W-W-H-W-W-W-H (2-2-1-2-2-2-1)
Dorian scale = W-H-W-W-W-H-W (2-1-2-2-2-1-2)
Phrygian scale = H-W-W-W-H-W-W (1,2,2,2,1,2,2)
Lydian scale = W-W-W-H-W-W-H (2,2,2,1,2,2,1)
Mixolydian scale = W-W-H-W-W-H-W (2,2,1,2,2,1,2)
Aeolian scale = W-H-W-W-H-W-W (2-1-2-2-1-2-2)
Locrian scale = H-W-W-H-W-W-W (1,2,2,1,2,2,2)
Whole tone scale = W-W-W-W-W-W (2-2-2-2-2-2)
Whole-Half Diminished = W-H-W-H-W-H-W-H (2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1)
Half-Whole Diminished = H-W-H-W-H-W-H-W (1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2)
